# Surfs_Up
## Project Overview

### Purpose
- Create a temperature summary for June.
- Create a temperature summary for December. 
- Determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable

### Background
Analyze temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Resources
- Data source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Python 3.9.7, Jupyter Notebook
- Data output: SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb, app.py, climate_analysis.ipynb

## Results

- The mean temperature in June is 74.9°F.
- The minimum temperature in June is 64.0°F.
- The maximum temperature in June is 85.0°F.

## Summary
From this information we can summarize the following:
- The difference between the 1st quartile of June and December is around 4°F, meaning the lower temperatures doesn't change drastically. We can see this more clearly with the following plots:

- Because the temperature doesn't change drasticallye between Summer and Winter, ice cream shop business should be sustainable year-round.
